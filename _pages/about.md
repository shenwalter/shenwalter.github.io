Hi! Iâ€™m Walter, a [PhD candidate](https://eps.harvard.edu/people/walter-shen) at Harvard University's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, where I am advised by Prof. Zhiming Kuang. My research focuses on cloud physics, as well as computational fluid dynamics and atmospheric dynamics broadly. Previously, I completed my undergrad at Imperial College London, where I studied applied mathematics. You can find my CV [here](https://shenwalter.github.io/files/Walter_Shen_CV_Aug_2023.pdf).

Please email me at walter_shen [at character] fas.harvard.edu if you'd like to chat about anything!
