Hi! I’m Walter, a [PhD student](https://eps.harvard.edu/people/walter-shen) at Harvard University's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, where I am advised by Prof. Zhiming Kuang. My research is broadly in modeling and simulating physical processes of Earth’s atmosphere. Previously, I completed my undergrad at Imperial College London, where I studied applied mathematics. You can find my CV [here](https://shenwalter.github.io/files/Walter_Shen_CV_Aug_2023.pdf).

I am proudly Massachusetts born and raised, and I'm currently a [Social Fellow](https://engage.gsas.harvard.edu/news/282632#:~:text=Walter%20Shen) at the Student Center at Harvard Griffin GSAS. I also play violin in the Student Center Orchestra, and I enjoy singing in choir!

Please email me at walter_shen [at character] fas.harvard.edu if you'd like to chat about anything!
